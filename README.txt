Android PDF Writer

DESCRIPTION:
A simple library to write simple PDF documents in Android.

NOTES:
I wrote this library because I couldn't find a library to write PDFs in Android and I needed one to complete a weekend project.
So, the current APW library was coded in a weekend (May 14-16, 2010) following the PDF 1.4 Reference (I think my implementation is compatible with lower PDF versions also), so expect limited functionality: it handles only 1 Page and provides limited functionality to it (writes text and paint lines... well, it covers pretty well the needs that my weekend project had at least, and may be it also address the needs of many other android projects out there with simple reporting needs).
There are so many things that can be added (images, filters, etc) and enhanced (it does not handle key/values for instance, etc etc etc), so if you add something that is useful for you (I think this library is a good base to be extended, check the class structure), please let me know since it might be helpful for others too.
Look at the PDFWriterDemo.java for a demonstration on how to use it, is very straightfoward.

HISTORY:
2010.05.19 - initial release
